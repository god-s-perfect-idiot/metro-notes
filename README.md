# Metro Notes - Android App

A Metro UI-designed notes app for Android, built with Svelte and Capacitor.

## Features

- 📝 Create and manage notes
- 🗑️ Delete notes
- 📱 Native Android app experience
- 🎨 Metro UI design language
- 💾 Local storage (notes persist between sessions)
- 📊 Custom status bar (fullscreen mode with custom UI)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Android Studio** (for Android development)
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (version 17 or higher)
- **Android SDK** (API level 33 or higher)

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Build the Web App

```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Sync with Android

```bash
npm run android:sync
```

This will create the Android project in the `android/` directory if it doesn't exist.

### 4. Open in Android Studio

```bash
npm run android:open
```

Or manually open the `android/` folder in Android Studio.

## Development

### Run Web Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts a development server at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Build and Sync Android

```bash
npm run android:build
```

This builds the web app and syncs it with the Android project.

### Run on Android Device/Emulator

1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Connect an Android device or start an emulator
3. Click the "Run" button in Android Studio

## Configuration

### Capacitor Config

The main configuration is in `capacitor.config.ts`:

- **appId**: `com.metronotes.app` 
- **appName**: `Metro Notes`

## Building for Production

### 1. Build the Web App

```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Sync with Android

```bash
npm run android:sync
```

### 3. Build APK/AAB in Android Studio

1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Go to **Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK**
3. Follow the wizard to create a signed release build

## Important Notes

### Data Storage

Notes are stored locally in the browser's localStorage. This means:
- Notes persist between app sessions
- Notes are stored per device/browser
- Clearing browser data will delete all notes

### Android Permissions

The app requires minimal permissions (automatically added by Capacitor):
- Internet access (for Capacitor plugins)

### Fullscreen Mode & Custom Status Bar

The app runs in fullscreen mode with a custom status bar:
- System status bar is hidden
- Custom status bar component shows time, battery, and network status
- Content area has proper padding to account for the custom status bar
- Configured in `src/main.js` using Capacitor's StatusBar plugin

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

- **"Module not found"**: Run `npm install` again
- **"Capacitor not found"**: Make sure Capacitor is installed: `npm install @capacitor/cli @capacitor/core @capacitor/android`

### Android Studio Issues

- **Gradle sync fails**: Update Android Studio and Gradle
- **SDK not found**: Install required SDK versions in Android Studio's SDK Manager

### Notes Issues

- **Notes not saving**: Check browser localStorage permissions
- **Notes disappearing**: Ensure you're not clearing browser data
